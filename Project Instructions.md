### Project Guidelines - EN.580.709

The goal of this project is to expose students to the vanguard of sparse representations in computer vision and machine learning,  as well as to stimulate independent study and research.

#### Guidelines:
1. This project is to be carried in pairs.
2. Go through the list of suggested papers and select one of your interest. Papers outside of this list will be allowed in unique cases, after consulting with me.
3. Once you have looked at the paper (enough to make sure it fits your interests), confirm your choice with me via email to get my approval. A paper cannot be chosen by more than one group, so I will update the list of available papers as I receive the requests.
4. It is expected that you don't simply restrict yourselves to the chosen paper - it is necessary to open a sphere of some radius and look at nearby related works to understand the general context of the paper's contribution.
5. Your project should include a summary of the chosen paper(s) with a discussion on the contribution and it's context, a discussion on the flaws and/or directions that were left unexplored, proposing improvement or modifications, adding simulations to reproduce or extend the paper's numerical experiments, and more.
6. Once you have studied the paper carefully and want to consult with me regarding your plan and the needed amount of work, make an appointment with me.
7. The final submission of the project is a report along the above lines to be handed in no later than **December 6th**. If your work contains novelties that are worthy of publication (consult with me about this), you can submit a 'paper' draft instead.
8. You are to present your project to the class during the last two weeks of classes (10-15 min presentation). 

#### Grading Criteria:
The project will be evaluated on:
* Effort
* Demonstration of subject understanding
* Originality (and elegance of the solution, if appropriate)
* Technical quality
* Efficient implementation
* Presentation clarity and quality
